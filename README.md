# Yan-K Toolkit

[繁體中文](README_TW.md) | [日本語](README_JP.md) | [English](README.md)

## Overview

The Yan-K series was originally released in 2014 as free scripts, developed to automate my animation workflow and practice coding. Over the past decade, these scripts have been used by many motion designers worldwide. I never expected them to be embraced by so many people, and I'm grateful to see these free tools contributing to the motion design community.

As my focus shifts, I have decided to **open-source all my AE scripts** under the **CC0 license**, meaning you are free to use, modify, integrate, and even sell them without any restrictions. However, I will no longer be providing technical support, bug fixes, or updates.
